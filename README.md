  # VC-Fire-Stations

Template Project for Hackathon By The Sea Attendees. This project is intended to be used as a template that can be further implemented. 

## Getting Started

Download the project files to your local hard drive, and open up the downloaded folder. 

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that you already have a version of Xcode installed on your Mac. This project was built using Xcode 9.4.1, so as long as your Xcode version is at least this, you should be good. 

### Build And Run

**1.** Once you've opened up VC Fire Stations, you will see the Project Navigator on the left of the window, the Xcode Toolbar on the top of the window, and you will see the source code editor in the middle of the window. 

**2.** The "Scheme Editor" is located on the Toolbar on the far left, and it allows you to specify which simulator device you want to run your app on. If "Generic iOS Device" is currently selected, click on this to change to an iPhone simulator device. Select iPhone X, or any other iPhone version you would like. 

**3.** Once you've selected a scheme to run the app on, we need to build and run the app. On the top menu, select Product->Run, or use Command-R as a shortcut, or select the Run button on the far left of the Toolbar (it looks like a play button). This will build and run the current project. 

**4.** If you have any issues during this time, please reach out to me. My contact info should be provided at one of the mentor tables, or ask for how to contact Richard Poutier.
